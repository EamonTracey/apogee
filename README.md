# NDRT ACS 2023-2024

The Notre Dame Rocketry Team (NDRT) competes in NASA's annual Student Launch competition. NASA scores each team's launch based on various criteria. 10% of the final score comes from altitude. Teams whose rockets peak closer to a chosen target apogee are awarded more points.

One way to achieve a target apogee is to tweak the rocket's physical qualities. For example, reshaping the nose cone, adding weights, and using a more powerful engine will impact launch behavior. However, given the complicated nature of a rocket launch, it is difficult to ensure the rocket behaves how you like. The problem becomes impossible when you consider not only the constant characteristics but also variable ones including wind velocity, air humidity, launch angle, etc.

Instead, NDRT uses a dynamic Apogee Control System (ACS) that makes real-time changes to the rocket's velocity in the air. ACS uses sensors to understand the rocket's trajectory and predicted apogee, and it determines the actuation of an airbrake to change the rocket's velocity accordingly. The physical characteristics of the rocket are designed to well-exceed the target apogee, and ACS ideally brings the apogee down to the target value.
